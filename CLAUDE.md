# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a demonstration project for Cloud Native Days Italy 2025, focused on showcasing FluxCD and Flagger implementations for advanced deployment strategies. The project illustrates modern GitOps practices and progressive delivery techniques.

## Purpose

- **Event**: Cloud Native Days Italy 2025 demonstration
- **Focus**: FluxCD and Flagger integration
- **Objective**: Demonstrate advanced deployment strategies including canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and automated rollbacks

## Current State

- **License**: MIT License (Copyright 2025 Riccardo Capraro)
- **Structure**: Initial setup phase
- **Technology Stack**: Will likely include Kubernetes manifests, FluxCD configurations, and Flagger resources

## Development Notes

As this demo project develops, expect to work with:

- Kubernetes YAML manifests for application deployments
- FluxCD GitRepository, Kustomization, and HelmRelease resources
- Flagger Canary resources for progressive delivery
- Application source code for demonstration purposes
- Monitoring and observability configurations

Future instances should look for standard cloud-native tooling patterns and GitOps workflows when this repository is populated with demonstration materials.
